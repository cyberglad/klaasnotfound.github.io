<em>Viral growth. Bad with diseases. Good for your product.</em></p>

<p>If your product is a mobile app or a web application with a simple signup process, it makes a lot of sense to 
facilitate word-of-mouth marketing by enabling existing users to invite new users and (possibly) reward them for 
successful invites. The reward could be anything from a monetary referral bonus in an online shop, replenished lives 
in a game, to the simple benefit of a better experience when friends join an ecosystem the inviter is already a part 
of. Once you have built this feature and can track when users send invites as well as when new users sign up via an 
invite, you might be wondering how to measure the speed and effectiveness of the organic growth driven by invites.
I’ll show you how to do exactly that.</p>

<p>If you want to skip the details, you can <a href="#in-a-nutshell">cut to the chase here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="viral-growth-and-the-k-factor">Viral Growth and the K-Factor</h3>

<p>When users invite new users, all that matters are <strong>two parameters</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <em>K-Factor</em> tells you how many new users each of your existing users acquires on average.</li>
  <li>The <em>viral cycle time</em> tells you how quickly that happens.</li>
</ul>

<p>As the term <em>viral</em> growth suggests, the terminology is borrowed from epidemiology. You can think of the <em>K-Factor</em> as
the contagiousness of the virus (how many people are infected by a person carrying the virus) and the 
<em>cycle time</em> as the infection interval (how long does it take for a newly infected person to infect others).
While both of these certainly sound unpleasant in the context of epidemic diseases, obviously “infections” are good 
when they mean people are spreading the word about your app. Specifically:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A high <em>K-Factor</em> is good. This means any infected person (an active user of your app) infects many other people 
(tells them about your app, they like it and start using it).</li>
  <li>A low <em>cycle time</em> is good. This means infections (active users successfully inviting new users) happen quickly.</li>
</ul>

<p>A <strong>K-Factor &gt; 1</strong> and a <strong>small cycle time</strong> can lead to explosive exponential growth. The general principle behind 
this is easily understandable (“If, on average, every user acquires a little more than one new user within a few days
and each of those users again acquires more than one new user …”). However, if you do the actual math and model the 
growth in a spreadsheet, the sensitivity of the exponential growth function with respect to both the <em>K-Factor</em>  and 
the <em>cycle time</em> can blow your mind. I won’t dig any deeper here, but I strongly suggest you do the modelling exercise 
for yourself, because it really helps you understand what difference minute optimizations in your app could make if 
they positively affect <em>K-Factor</em>  or <em>cycle time</em>.</p>

<h3 id="the-k-factor-in-theory">The K-Factor in Theory</h3>

<p>If you go by the textbook (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-Factor_(marketing)">Wikipedia</a>) definition of the 
<em>K-Factor</em>, it is to be calculated as</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{align*}
  k = i \cdot c
\end{align*}</script>

<p>where <script type="math/tex">i</script> is the number of invites sent by a user (e.g. 5 invites sent), and <script type="math/tex">c</script> is the average conversion rate of 
those invites (e.g. 1 in 5 invites = 20% accepted). So in order to calculate the <em>K-Factor</em> of each user, we would 
need to know how many people the user sent invites to and how many of those invites were accepted. Once we have 
calculated the individual <em>K-Factor</em> for each user, we can average them up and - boom! - there is the <em>K-Factor</em> for 
our app.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/content/kfactor_02.png" alt="" class="ui big centered image" /></p>

<h3 id="the-thing-with-invites">The Thing with Invites</h3>

<p>While the idea of tracking each and every invite may sound appealing, it’s actually not that straightforward in 
practice. No matter how you design your invite system - at a certain point your users will have to share some sort of 
information <em>externally</em> (an invite link, a referral code). This is where you end up in a dilemma:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Sharing should be as easy and convenient as possible in order to maximize dissemination. However, if you just let 
the user copy the invite info or share it via another app, you lose track of who and how many people the invite is 
actually sent to.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If, on the other hand, you want to have total control of the sharing/sending process you have to ask for a bunch of
permissions (address book, sending text messages etc.) that will make your app look like a creepy control freak.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The following is a real-life screenshot of the Android permission page of a popular location-sharing app that handles 
all sharing activity from within the app:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/content/kfactor_03.png" alt="" class="ui big centered image" /></p>

<p><em>My advice to you</em>: If you don’t need these permissions for other, well-justified use cases - <strong>don’t do this. Ever.</strong> 
The top priority is that your users share invites. This process should be as comfortable as possible and should thus 
make use of the built-in sharing dialogs or the “copy to clipboard” functionality of the host OS. These require no 
extra permissions and the user can freely decide how, when and with whom they want to share the invite. Also, you 
won’t have to implement and maintain a slew of additional sharing functionality that has nothing to do with the core 
of your app.</p>

<p>Before we proceed, let me remark that - even though you don’t have detailed stats on sent invites with the external 
sharing approach - you can still know which users try to share an invite. To obtain this info, log an analytics
event right before users leave your app to share, e.g. when they have requested a referral code and click on “Share” 
or “Copy”. This way you will have a pretty good estimate of which users share invites and how quickly/often they do so.</p>

<h3 id="the-k-factor-in-practice">The K-Factor in Practice</h3>

<p>So if we don’t track how many invites are sent to whom, how can we calculate the K-Factor at all? Well, it turns out 
it is still feasible. In fact it’s rather easy. Let’s take another look at the formula of the <em>K-Factor</em>:
<script type="math/tex">k = i \cdot c</script>. Seeing how the conversion rate <script type="math/tex">c</script> is simply the ratio of <em>invites accepted</em> and  <em>invites sent</em>
(<script type="math/tex">i</script>) per user, we can just cancel <em>invites sent</em> (<script type="math/tex">i</script>) from the equation and end up with:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{align*}
  k = \textrm{# of successfully invited users}
\end{align*}</script>

<p>The formula is basically just a fancy way of saying that invites do play a role in acquiring new users (if you don’t 
send any invites, you can’t acquire new users, duh). But <strong>for calculating the <em>K-Factor</em> the only thing that’s 
relevant is how many invites were accepted</strong> and not how many invites were actually sent. In other words, a user that 
sends 20 invites and acquires 2 new users has the same <em>K-Factor</em> as a user who sends 2 invites and acquires 2 new 
users (namely <script type="math/tex">k=2</script>).</p>

<p>So to calculate the <em>K-Factor</em> we simply need to track how many invites from a given user were accepted. This should 
be fairly easy, because new users will join via the invite link or the referral code that was sent to them, which 
let’s us identify who invited them. Then we average up the individual <em>K-Factors</em> and - bazinga! - there is the 
<em>K-Factor</em> for our app.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/content/kfactor_04.jpg" alt="" class="ui huge centered image" />
<em>What window are we looking at?</em></p>

<h3 id="time-window-and-relevant-users">Time Window and Relevant Users</h3>

<p>Now that we’re clear on how to handle invites, calculation should be straightforward. There is just one issue: Like 
most other performance metrics, we would like a rolling analysis of the <em>K-Factor</em> <strong>based on a fixed time window</strong>, 
e.g. the past day, the past week, the past month etc. We do the same with metrics like retention (“Of all users 
that installed my app two days ago, how many came back yesterday?”), so surely this should be possible for the 
<em>K-Factor</em>?</p>

<p>It is possible, but we need to realize several things about how growth by invites works.</p>

<ul>
  <li>A bunch of users might be actively using your product, but not all of them are relevant for calculating the 
<em>K-Factor</em>.</li>
  <li>Unless your product is invite-only (e.g. in early beta) you will have both <em>invited signups</em> and <em>normal signups</em>.</li>
  <li>Chains of invites can occur within a single day or span multiple days.</li>
  <li>Invites could be sent by both <em>existing users</em> and by newly <em>invited users</em>.</li>
  <li>Unless your invites expire, it’s impossible to specify an upper limit on the acceptance time.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>With these aspects in mind <strong>here’s an exercise for you</strong>: If today is <em>Day 0</em> and you have analytics data (normal 
signups, invited signups) for the past <em>3</em> days, try to calculate the <em>K-Factor</em> for <em>Day -3</em> (three days ago).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If your thought process throughout this exercise was similar to mine, you may have come to the following conclusions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>To be able to calculate a (lower bound approximation of) <em>the K-Factor</em> we need to <strong>specify a time window that 
corresponds to the expected <em>cycle time</em></strong>. Given the specifics of our app (when and how often do we ask users to 
invite others, how easy is that process, how easy is it to accept, how long does it typically take to accept), the 
time window is a best guess for the period in which <em>invited users</em> are “hot” and could “infect” other users. 
It also reflects the maximum time span in which a sent invite must be accepted to be counted.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the chosen time window we should <strong>consider two groups of users</strong>: a) “Old” users that send an invite during 
the time window and b) all new users who signed up during the time window. The rest of our user base should be 
ignored, even if they are active.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The reasoning behind the first conclusion should be obvious. If there is an expiry time for invites, we can simply 
use that as our time window. If there isn’t, we have a problem: An invite could be accepted after one day or after 
ten years. In order to come up with any number for the <em>K-Factor</em> we must specify a reasonable threshold for the time
window. For the referral program of a real estate company this could be months or even years, for inviting someone to
use an app it should probably be no more than a few days. Here’s the good news: You can learn the time window from the 
behavior of your users. For example, if 80% of your inviters send an invite within the first 2 days, you could use 
that as your threshold. Also, no matter what time window you choose, you will never <em>overestimate</em> the 
<em>K-Factor</em>, since invites could be accepted after the time window and the actual <em>K-Factor</em> will be better than your 
estimate. The challenge is to find a time window that is sufficiently short so that you get timely estimates, but 
long enough that the majority of relevant invite activity is considered.</p>

<p>The second conclusion may not be as obvious, so join me in this thought experiment: If you have 5.000 daily active 
users when you start your invite program how many of them should contribute to the <em>K-Factor</em>? All of them? Certainly
not, because then your <em>K-Factor</em> would be unrealistically bad (lots of users who didn’t acquire new users). None of 
them? Probably also not a good idea, because what if 500 of them actually started to send out invites? You’d leave 
out all those invites. So for your existing active user base the most reasonable thing seems to be to consider those 
users who send out invites during your analysis time window.</p>

<p>Great, so what about new users that sign up once your invite program is in place? Should we only consider users that
joined through an invite? Or just those that send an invite? I personally think neither is a good idea. By the 
time your invite program is integrated into your product, new users should be incentivized to invite others as part of
the onboarding process, at a point where they are sufficiently engaged with your product and can be considered “fully 
infected”. This should be regardless of whether those users signed up via an invite or not. By the same logic, all 
fully onboarded or “infected” users should be regarded as potential disseminators, not just the ones that actually 
send out invites. Suppose that the invites sent from your app would be super effective (e.g. have a conversion rate of 
<script type="math/tex">c=1</script>) but, for some strange reason, you could only get very few new users to actually send out invites. 
If you considered only users that send out invites, your <em>K-Factor</em> would seem to be phenomenal, while in reality it 
would be rather low. To avoid this bias, you must consider all newly signed up users in your analysis window.</p>

<h3 id="a-toy-example">A Toy Example</h3>

<p>Now that we have all the ingredients lined up, let’s go through a toy example.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/content/kfactor_05.png" alt="" class="ui huge centered image" />
<em>A fictitious chain of signups and invites over three days.</em></p>

<p>Today is <em>Day 0</em> and the figure shows analytics data for the past three days. Each row represents an entire day and the 
dots within the rows represent signup and/or invite events, ordered chronologically from top left to bottom right within
each day. Obviously more users are active on any given day, but as explained above, we only consider users that 
either signed up on that day or had signed up before and sent invites on that day.</p>

<p>The figure reads as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Red dots represent users that signed up normally (not via an invite) and did not send any invites.</li>
  <li>Blue dots represent (new or existing) users who sent at least one invite.</li>
  <li>Yellow circles mark users who signed up via an invite. The black lines connect them to their respective inviter.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s assume that the time window / expected <em>cycle time</em> for the app is 2 days. This means we have the full data to 
calculate the <em>K-Factor</em> for <em>Day -3</em>. The histogram of individual user <em>K-Factors</em> on that day is:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align: center"># Successful Invites</th>
      <th style="text-align: center"># Users</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center">0</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center">1</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center">2</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center">3</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center">4</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">1</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>which gives us an average <em>K-Factor</em> of</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{align*}
  k = \frac{0\cdot3 + 1\cdot1 + 2\cdot0 + 3\cdot2 + 4\cdot1}{3+1+0+2+1} = \frac{11}{7} = 1.57

<h3 id="in-a-nutshell">In a Nutshell</h3>

<p>To summarize, here are the key takeaways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If your app, website or product has a simple signup process, it is a good idea to implement an invite system to 
accelerate growth.</li>
  <li>Inviting new users can be incentivized but doesn’t have to. Invites can be really effective when they are actually 
a feature of your product (“challenge your friends”, “recruit three backers” etc.).</li>
  <li>Make your invite functionality as easy and convenient as possible. For apps, use the inbuilt sharing mechanisms 
that require no extra permissions.</li>
  <li>Track when invites are shared and when new users sign up via an invite. You might not be able to track to which and
how many users an invite is sent. That’s ok.</li>
  <li>Define a time window that represents a reasonable estimate of how long it takes a new user to engage with your 
product, send out invites and cause others to join via an invite.</li>
  <li>For your app to go viral via invites, the time window should be on the order of days, not weeks or months. Let’s 
call the number of days <script type="math/tex">d</script>.</li>
  <li>To calculate the <em>K-Factor</em> <script type="math/tex">d</script> days ago, count the number of users that signed up <em>or</em> sent an invite on that 
day. Let’s call that number the <em>active users</em> <script type="math/tex">a</script>.</li>
  <li>For each active user, count the number of invited signups that the user caused (= successful invites) within the 
last <script type="math/tex">d</script> days (i.e. until today). Record this number <em>per user</em> and let’s call it the individual <em>K-Factor</em> <script type="math/tex">k_i</script>.</li>
  <li>The <em>K-Factor</em> is then calculated simply as the average of the individual <em>K-Factors</em>:</li>
</ul>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{align*}
  k = \frac{1}{a} \sum{k_i}
\end{align*}</script>

<p>Simple enough, really. However, figuring out which users to consider in which time frame took me some time, so I’m 
hoping this article may spare you one or several mental detours.</p>
