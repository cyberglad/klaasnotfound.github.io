            <h2>Continuous Integration with Git Submodules</h2>
            
            <blockquote><b>tl;dr</b> Git submodules are great for sharing code between repos, but somewhat tricky when testing/building them in the cloud. I'll show you a working setup.</blockquote>
            

            <p>Two things are really awesome: 1) Automatically having your code tested upon committing it to a repository and 2)
reusing shared code across different repositories. In this post I will outline how to do both. Specifically, I 
will show you how to set up a working continuous integration build, using the new and fabulous
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/product/features/pipelines">Bitbucket Pipelines</a> with a repository that has a submodule 
dependency.</p>

<p>Having a <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule">Git submodule</a> in your repo makes the CI setup slightly
non-trivial, so this post was partially written as a “note to future self” (as I won’t remember how to do this 6 months 
from now ;-). Let’s get right to it.</p>

<h3 id="git-submodules">Git Submodules</h3>

<p>Suppose we have two individual projects, <em>Foo</em> and <em>Bar</em>, each in their own Git repository. Both use a model class 
called <em>Doobidoo</em> (in this example a Javascript file, but it could be any kind of source file). The repo structure of 
both <em>Foo</em> and <em>Bar</em> might look like this:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code>src/
├ controller/
└ model/
  ├ ...
  └  Doobidoo.js
test/
└ model/
  ├ ...
  └  Doobidoo.spec.js
</code></pre></div>

<p>As both projects evolve, the model class <em>Doobidoo</em> is enhanced and updated on a regular basis. Because the codebase is 
awesome, we of course write and update unit tests, which are stored in <em>test/Doobidoo.spec.js</em>. This file, too, is 
updated regularly. Both projects expect to work with the same model class, so whenever the source code of 
<em>Doobidoo.js</em> or its associated tests is changed within one repo, it must be updated in the other repo. How do we 
achieve such a sync?</p>

<p><img src="/assets/content/submodules_00.jpg" alt="" class="ui huge centered image" />
<em>A repository within a repository within a …</em></p>

<p>After dismissing crazy ideas like symlinks or manually copying the contents back and forth, a quick Google search 
should convince you that this scenario is 
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28357350/two-git-repositories-share-common-code">a perfect fit for Git submodules</a>.
You can think of a submodule as a simple Git repo within your repo. The <code>git submodule</code> family of commands makes sure
that your outer repository treats the inner, shared repository with respect. That’s all I’ll explain about submodules
 at this point - if you want to learn more, go ahead and read
<a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules">the official tutorial</a>.</p>

<p>So what do we do with the shared code, then? We create a new Git repo <em>Shared</em> with the following structure:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code>src/
└ model/
  └  Doobidoo.js
test/
└ model/
  └  Doobidoo.spec.js
</code></pre></div>

<p>Let’s assume this new repo lives at URL <code>&lt;shared-repo-url&gt;</code>. To add the submodule to <em>Foo</em> and <em>Bar</em>, we can now 
delete the <em>Doobidoo*.js</em> source files from both those repos and then run <code>git submodule add &lt;shared-repo-url&gt; 
shared/</code> within the root folder of each project. The structure of <em>Foo</em> and <em>Bar</em> will now be</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code>shared/
├ src/
| └ model/
|   └  Doobidoo.js
└ test/
  └ model/
    └  Doobidoo.spec.js
src/
├ controller/
└ model/
  └ ...
test/
  └ ...
</code></pre></div>

<p><em>Note:</em> The <code>git submodule add</code> command adds a <code>.gitmodules</code> file to the outer repo, which you need to add and push. 
Also, the first time around you may need to run <code>git submodule init</code> followed by <code>git submodule update</code> in the outer 
repo to make sure the latest version of your <em>Shared</em> repo ends up in the shared folder. After that you should adapt 
all references to <em>Doobidoo.js</em> within the <em>Foo</em> and <em>Bar</em> projects.  For example, a reference that formerly pointed to 
<code>./model/Doobidoo.js</code> would now read <code>../shared/src/model/Doobidoo.js</code>. When you’re done, make sure all your unit 
tests are up to date
and passing.</p>

<p><strong>Part 1 is done</strong> - we have moved the shared code to a Git submodule! Simply treat the code inside the <code>shared/</code> 
folder like you would treat any other repo. If you change anything within the folder (regardless of whether you 
change it in the <em>Foo</em> or the <em>Bar</em> project or elsewhere), you can query the changes with <code>git status</code> then <code>git add</code>, 
<code>git commit</code> and <code>git push</code> them. Afterwards <code>git pull</code> the changes from all other repos that use the submodule. Be 
sure to run all these commands within the <code>shared/</code> folder.</p>

<h3 id="continuous-integration-with-bitbucket-pipelines">Continuous Integration with Bitbucket Pipelines</h3>

<p>If you have ever browsed the codebase of an open source project on Github, you will be familiar with the status
badge that usually (and hopefully) looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/content/submodules_01.png" alt="" class="ui small centered image" /></p>

<p>How does GitHub know whether the latest code that was pushed to the repository is actually passing the tests in the 
codebase? The short answer: It doesn’t. The badges are powered by third party continuous integration services, such as 
<a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis CI</a> and 
<a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-alternatives-to-Travis-CI">others</a>. In a nutshell, these services listen to 
changes in your repo and fire up a virtual machine in the cloud that runs your unit tests every time you 
push something. Pretty neat, huh?</p>

<p>When you’re working on open source projects everything is fine and dandy - both GitHub and Travis are free for such. 
However, should you not be ready to share your code with the world… well, you’re out of luck. This is where both 
GitHub and Travis expect some dough and - to be honest - I think this is a very fair business model. Nevertheless, 
for a personal project, the fees may strike you as somewhat hefty. If you’re comfortable with it, go ahead and spend 
that $7/month on a personal GitHub account and $129/month <strong>(!)</strong> on Travis.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/content/submodules_02.jpg" alt="" class="ui huge centered image" />
<em>Look at them pipes…</em></p>

<p>Or don’t. Because recently, something awesome happened. As you might know, Atlassian, the enterprise software giant 
and maker of JIRA and Confluence, has been offering <em>free</em> unlimited private Git repos for small teams (up to 5 people)
as part of its cloud-hosted <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">Bitbucket</a> platform for quite some time now. Up to now, that’s what
it was to me - a code silo for personal projects. However, recently Atlassian added something very cool on top:
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/product/features/pipelines">Bitbucket Pipelines</a>. Rather then plugging in third party 
providers (like the GitHub + Travis model), Pipelines is <em>an integral part</em> of Bitbucket, meaning you get a fully 
integrated CI solution with your hosted repo. Pipelines is currently in beta (there is 1-2 day wait after you sign 
up), but already it feels pretty awesome. I played around with it and liked it for several reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Having CI as an integrated part of a cloud-hosted repo feels very natural.</li>
  <li>The UI is nice and clean.</li>
  <li>It’s currently <em>free</em> (with a limited quota of 300 build minutes / month).</li>
</ul>

<p>There is no word on the pricing yet, but I’m hoping Atlassian will challenge GitHub/Travis by continuing to offer a 
basic free tier (limited build minutes, one instance) after Pipelines leaves beta. We’ll see ;-)</p>

<p>Enough chatter - let’s look at how we would test the repos described above with Bitbucket Pipelines. Assuming the 
remote of each repo lives on Bitbucket (i.e. at <code>https://bitbucket.org/&lt;user-or-org&gt;/&lt;repo&gt;.git</code>) and that you have 
successfully signed up for Pipelines, we first enable Pipelines in the repo’s settings:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/content/submodules_03.png" alt="" class="ui big centered image" /></p>

<p>Then, create a file called <code>bitbucket-pipelines.yml</code> in the root folder of your repo. This is where you specify what 
kind of image / environment the build should run in and what is to be tested. Let’s assume that  <em>Foo</em> and 
<em>Bar</em> from above are simple <em>Node.js</em> projects and that all unit tests are run by invoking <code>npm test</code>. Then, a valid 
<code>bitbucket-pipelines.yml</code> would look like this:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-yaml"><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">image</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">node</span>

<span class="l-Scalar-Plain">pipelines</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span>
  <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">default</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span>
    <span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">step</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span>
        <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">script</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span>
          <span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">npm --version</span>
          <span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">npm install</span>
          <span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">npm test</span></code></pre></div>

<p>Simple enough, really. Once you push this file to the repo (and on every subsequent push or pull request), Pipelines 
will spring to life, run your tests and decorate your branches with a test status. You can follow the log output if 
you like (I found this to be very entertaining at least for the first couple of builds ;-).</p>

<p><img src="/assets/content/submodules_04.png" alt="" class="ui huge centered image" /></p>

<p><strong>Part 2 is done</strong> - now you know what Pipelines is and how to enable and trigger cloud-based builds with it.</p>

<h3 id="putting-it-together">Putting it Together</h3>

<p>I have to make a confession. When I told you that the above <code>bitbucket-pipelines.yml</code> would trigger a successful 
build of the <em>Foo</em> and <em>Bar</em> repos, that was only partially true. For the initial version (without the submodule) 
everything would indeed work fine. However, for the refactored version, the test script will fail:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/content/submodules_05.png" alt="" class="ui huge centered image" /></p>

<p>The (Node.js) error would read something like</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code>Error: Cannot find module '../shared/src/model/Doobidoo'
</code></pre></div>

<p>What’s going on here? We <em>did</em> update all the references to <em>Doobidoo.js</em> and made sure our unit tests were passing 
locally, so this cannot be an issue with relative paths. Indeed it is not - the problem is simpler: On the virtual 
machine Pipelines first clones a fresh copy of our repository before running the tests. Without explicitly telling 
Pipelines to pull submodules, too, this copy will <em>not</em> contain the <code>shared/</code> folder with our submodule code. Darn!</p>

<p>So surely we can just tell Pipelines to first pull all the submodules, too, right? You bet!</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-yaml"><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">image</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">node</span>

<span class="l-Scalar-Plain">pipelines</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span>
  <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">default</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span>
    <span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">step</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span>
        <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">script</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span>
          <span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">git submodule update --init --recursive</span>
          <span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">npm --version</span>
          <span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">npm install</span>
          <span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">npm test</span></code></pre></div>

<p>The <code>git submodule update --init --recursive</code> tells Pipelines to first and foremost clone all submodules contained 
within the repo, which is what we want. Let’s push again and trigger a new build:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/content/submodules_06.png" alt="" class="ui huge centered image" /></p>

<p>Oh, dear, what’s wrong now? You probably already guessed it - the <em>Shared</em> repo that you added as a submodule needs 
to be pulled from the <code>&lt;shared-repo-url&gt;</code> using some sort of authentication. When you added it locally on your 
machine, chances are that that you used a working SSH configuration for the URL, e.g. 
<code>git@&lt;personal-bitbucket&gt;:&lt;user-or-org&gt;/&lt;shared-repo-name&gt;.git</code>. In that case the error will read:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code>ssh: Could not resolve hostname &lt;personal-bitbucket&gt;: Name or service not known
</code></pre></div>

<p>The way things are at the moment, the virtual machine that Pipelines fires up cannot possibly know about your SSH 
authentication for the shared repository (<em>nor should it!</em>). So what do we do? Tell Pipelines about 
<code>&lt;personal-bitbucket&gt;</code> and add your private SSH key to the build script? That would be a very bad idea for several 
reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You should <strong>never, ever</strong> use a personal auth key for an automated process.</li>
  <li>Keys used by an automated process should always have <strong>read-only</strong> access to repos.</li>
  <li>You shouldn’t put verbatim keys in repository source code.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s think about how authentication works on your machine. In your <code>~/.ssh/config</code> file you probably have an entry 
similar to this:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash"><span class="c"># My Bitbucket configuration</span>
Host personal-bitbucket
   HostName bitbucket.org
   User git
   IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_my_private_key</code></pre></div>

<p>Basically, we would like our Pipelines script to have a similar configuration of its own (with read-only access to 
the repo). Fortunately, like most cloud-hosted repository providers, Bitbucket allows us to configure such access by 
using so-called 
<a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/use-deployment-keys-294486051.html">Deployment Keys</a>.
So here is how we fix our build, step by step.</p>

<h4 id="generate-a-deployment-key">1. Generate a Deployment Key</h4>

<p>In your console navigate to <code>~/.ssh/</code> and run</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash">ssh-keygen -q -t rsa -N <span class="s2">&quot;&quot;</span> -C <span class="s2">&quot;&lt;email_address&gt;&quot;</span> -f &lt;filename&gt;</code></pre></div>

<p>The email address is rather unimportant, but for sake of completeness you may want to put a sensible real-life contact 
for your automated script here. The filename should have <em>no extension</em> and could be something like 
<code>id_rsa_myproject_ci</code>. You should now have a public key (<code>id_rsa_myproject_ci.pub</code>) and a private key 
(<code>id_rsa_myproject_ci</code>) for the continuous integration account in your <code>~/.ssh/</code> folder.</p>

<p>Now is a good time to add this key to your <code>~/.ssh/config</code> file (we will need it later). Go ahead and create the 
following entry:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash"><span class="c"># Bitbucket configuration for continuous integration account</span>
Host myproject-ci-bitbucket
   HostName bitbucket.org

<h4 id="add-the-deployment-key-to-bitbucket">2. Add the Deployment Key to Bitbucket</h4>

<p>Go to the <em>Settings</em> &gt; <em>Deployment Keys</em> section of your <em>Shared</em> repository on Bitbucket. Click on <em>Add Key</em>, give 
it a <em>Label</em> and paste the content of the <em>public keyfile</em> (<code>id_rsa_myproject_ci.pub</code>) in the <em>Key</em> field.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/content/submodules_07.png" alt="" class="ui huge centered image" /></p>

<p>After saving the key, our CI account will now have read-only access to the <em>Shared</em> repo. Sweet!</p>

<h4 id="add-the-private-key-as-an-environment-variable">3. Add the Private Key as an Environment Variable</h4>

<p>The build script will need to pull the repo using the SSH identity we just created, so at one point, it must have 
access to the private key file. Since we don’t want to put the private key in the source code, the cleanest way is to
use an environment variable. Again, Bitbucket has us covered. In fact, we have two choices - 
<a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/environment-variables-in-bitbucket-pipelines-794502608.html#EnvironmentvariablesinBitbucketPipelines-User-definedvariables">Repository Variables</a>
and <a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/environment-variables-in-bitbucket-pipelines-794502608.html#EnvironmentvariablesinBitbucketPipelines-User-definedvariables">Account Variables</a>.
If you plan on using the CI account only for one shared repo, you can choose the former, otherwise (and this is what 
we’ll do) you can add the key as a (global) account environment variable.</p>

<p>Navigate to <em>Bitbucket Settings</em> (top right, by your avatar pic), then to <em>Environment Variables</em>. Add a new variable
<code>MYPROJECT_CI_PRIVATE_KEY</code>. For the value paste the content of the private key file (<code>id_rsa_myproject_ci</code>), however, 
replace all line breaks with the <code>\n</code> literal before pasting. Be sure to check the <em>Secured</em> box, which will ensure that
the key is never actually visible in the settings.</p>

<h4 id="update-the-build-script">4. Update the Build Script</h4>

<p>Now that we have our deployment key in place and the private key at the ready, it’s time to put everything together. 
In a nutshell, once the virtual machine has booted up, we want to</p>

<ul>
  <li>Write the private deployment key to an identity file.</li>
  <li>Add an SSH configuration with the new identity file.</li>
  <li>Pull the submodules.</li>
</ul>

<p>And here is how we do it:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-yaml"><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">image</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">node</span>

<span class="l-Scalar-Plain">pipelines</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span>
  <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">default</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span>
    <span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">step</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span>
        <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">script</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span>
          <span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">mkdir ~/.ssh</span>
          <span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">echo -e $MYPROJECT_CI_PRIVATE_KEY &gt; ~/.ssh/id_rsa_myproject_ci</span>
          <span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa_myproject_ci</span>
          <span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">echo -e &quot;Host myproject-ci-bitbucket\n   HostName bitbucket.org\n   User git\n   IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_myproject_ci\n   StrictHostKeyChecking no&quot; &gt; ~/.ssh/config</span>
          <span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">chmod 600 ~/.ssh/config</span>
          <span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">git submodule update --init --recursive</span>
          <span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">npm --version</span>
          <span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">npm install</span>
          <span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">npm test</span></code></pre></div>

<p>Are we done? Almost. There is one tiny thing missing: The submodule we added to the <em>Foo</em> and <em>Bar</em> repos back in the 
day still uses the old <code>&lt;shared-repo-url&gt;</code>. Let’s go ahead and update that. Instead of using some <code>git submodule</code> 
command, you may edit the URL directly in the <code>.gitmodules</code> file, which should then look like this:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code>[submodule "shared"]
	path = shared
	url = git@myproject-ci-bitbucket:&lt;user-or-org&gt;/&lt;shared-repo-name&gt;.git
</code></pre></div>

<p>Run <code>git submodule sync</code> once and make sure your tests still work locally, then push the new 
<code>bitbucket-pipelines.yml</code> and <code>.gitmodules</code> file (for the <em>Foo</em> and/or <em>Bar</em> project). Tuuuhduuuuuh - we should again
see a passing build:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/content/submodules_09.png" alt="" class="ui huge centered image" /></p>

<p><strong>Part 3 is done</strong> - we have successfully set up a Bitbucket pipelines build of a repo with a submodule dependency!</p>

<h3 id="using-other-platforms">Using Other Platforms</h3>

<p>Of course, you can achieve a similar setup on other platforms, including GitHub + Travis. Instead of a 
<code>bitbucket-pipelines.yml</code> you would use a <code>.travis.yml</code> and instead of a deployment key you may want to think about 
using <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use/">Access Tokens</a>, which are 
even easier to use than an SSH key pair.</p>

<p>The main takeaway from this blog post is that it makes sense to use Git submodules for shared code and that - 
with a little extra effort - you can use a CI service such as Pipelines or Travis to test a repo with submodule 
dependencies. All you have to do is to make sure that the build script will be able to pull the submodules before 
running the build.</p>
