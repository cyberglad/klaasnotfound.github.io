            <p>People, it’s 2016. Writing a location-aware app in Android should be simple. Unfortunately, it’s not. If you want to 
support a decent range of versions (let’s say API level 14 and newer, 97% of Android users) you’re faced with a number
of issues. I struggled with these for several days and thought I would share my lessons learned - and the code that came
out of it.

<em>Stop mocking me.</em></p>

<p>A particular requirement in my case was that I needed the user’s <em>real</em> location. In other words I wanted to detect
and reliably reject fake locations. As you might know, Android officially allows the installation of so-called ‘mock 
location’ apps. Most of them are called something like ‘Fake GPS’ and broadcast a location chosen by the user (for 
example at the north pole) to the system, just like a regular GPS provider. Most apps silently accept mock locations 
and in fact teleporting yourself to the ends of the earth can be incredibly handy when testing app features or 
previewing your next vacation destination. However, it can also be a real pain, especially when your app depends on 
the authenticity of location information, e.g. for check-ins, location-based rewards etc.</p>

<h3 id="the-objective">The Objective</h3>

<p>In general, I wanted to do four things whenever my app was started/resumed:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Request location updates with a certain accuracy and at fixed update intervals.</li>
  <li>If necessary (on newer Android systems), ask the user to grant permission to retrieve location info.</li>
  <li>If disabled, ask the user to enable location providers, ideally without leaving the app.</li>
  <li>Detect and reject mock locations and ask the user to switch off mock location apps.</li>
</ol>

<p>Getting the location permission is pretty straightforward, as there is a 
<a href="http://developer.android.com/training/permissions/requesting.html">nice tutorial</a>
on how to request permissions at run time on systems with API level ≥ 23 (Marshmallow and above).
Getting updates from the location providers can be a bit tricky, because there are two ways to do it. You can 
subscribe directly to the different available location providers (GPS, Network, Bluetooth) via the <strong>LocationManager</strong>
on the device. For a long time, this used to be the main method of obtaining location info and you had to basically 
write your own logic to fuse the location info from different providers.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/content/stop_mocking_me_02.png" alt="" class="ui large centered image" />
<em>Location Settings on Android Marshmallow</em></p>

<p>Not so long ago, Google introduced the 
<a href="https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/location/package-summary">Play Services Location API</a>
as an alternative that simplifies a lot of the manual effort and abstracts a number of issues. It is actually quite 
nice and - unless you need really fine-grained control of the location sources - it’s definitely the way to go.
The utility class I’m introducing below is built on top of the Google Play Services API. You can read Google’s intro
<a href="http://developer.android.com/training/location/index.html">‘Making Your App Location-Aware’</a>
if you want to learn more about it.</p>

<h3 id="the-recipe">The Recipe</h3>

<p>The following diagram shows the exact order of steps that I have found necessary to reliably obtain location updates 
on the aforementioned API levels.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/content/stop_mocking_me_03.png" alt="" class="ui fluid image" />
<em>The 6 steps to location Nirvana.</em></p>

<p>The orange boxes denote situations in which a user action is required. Let me walk you through the steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Check Permission</strong>: On older Android versions, this step is irrelevant, as the user has to grant permission at 
install time. Starting with Marshmallow, the permission mechanism became more refined (similar to the way it works on
iOS). The user must now grant permission at run time and you must do a better job at explaining why your app needs 
location permission. Depending on how obvious your app’s need for location information is, you could first show a 
small explanation and then request the permission or directly request it. Either way, if the user declines, you 
should show a more detailed explanation. Once permission is granted, you may proceed to step 2.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Request Access</strong>: Here, we are asking the Google API to give us access to location information with a certain 
accuracy / 
<a href="https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/location/LocationRequest#constant-summary">priority</a>
(choices are <em>HIGH</em>, <em>BALANCED</em>, <em>LOW</em>, <em>NO_POWER</em>) and update frequency. The API automatically decides which 
location providers are necessary to meet your requirements. For example, if you need high accuracy, it is likely that
GPS will be switched on, while for balanced or low accuracy it might be sufficient to just use network location 
(WiFi and cell tower).
Requesting access can result in three outcomes:
    <ul>
      <li><em>Unavailable</em> means that for some reason, it is and won’t be possible to change the location settings with the 
 in-app dialog to meet your requirements. I decided, that the most reasonable step in this case is to direct the 
 user to the system location settings so she/he can figure out what’s going on.</li>
      <li><em>Resolution</em> means that some providers are currently switched off, but it is possible to switch them from an 
 in-app dialog. This is where you want to interact with the user to possibly explain the situation and then ask 
 her/him to  enable the necessary providers.</li>
      <li><em>Success</em> means all the necessary providers are enabled and you may proceed to step 3.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Request Updates</strong>: Having been granted access, we now subscribe to periodic updates in this step. Nothing
should go wrong here (unless there are connectivity issues).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Check Availability</strong>: The Google API offers a simple check to determine if location info is available. This will
include the best “last known position”, so it’s a good idea to check availability up front, even if your GPS is still
searching for a fix. If no location info is available after the Google API reports providers were switched on and 
updates were successfully requested, it’s a good idea to manually check the location providers (via the 
LocationManager). Oftentimes this is redundant to the Google API check, however, I saw some cases on older Android 
phones / distros where this fallback was actually necessary.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Check for Mock Locations</strong>: Once we acquire a new location reading, this step aims to determine whether the info
is real or fake. Read the following section for more info on how this is done.</p>
  </li>
  <li>We’re <strong>good to go</strong> and should be receiving location updates.</li>
</ol>

<p><a id="the-disappointment"></a></p>

<h3 id="the-disappointment">The Disappointment</h3>

<p>Implementing steps 1-6 is mostly busywork. However, step 5 - detecting mock locations - can trip you up pretty bad. 
On older Android systems (&lt; API level 18) mock locations are detected via Android’s 
<a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/Settings.Secure.html#ALLOW_MOCK_LOCATION"><strong>Settings.Secure</strong></a>
flag. This works reliably and will cause your app to generally reject <em>any kind of location</em> until mock locations are 
disabled in the system settings.</p>

<p>The trouble starts on systems with API level 18 and up: The new flag 
<a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/location/Location
.html#isFromMockProvider%28%29"><strong>Location.isFromMockProvider()</strong></a>
is supposed to flag mock locations on a <em>per-location</em> basis. In general this is a good idea, as it provides more 
fine-grained control and could even be used to simultaneously process location info from fake and real providers.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/content/stop_mocking_me_04.png" alt="" class="ui big centered image" />
<em>Let’s go somewhere warm.</em></p>

<p>So let’s beam ourselves to Brazil for a moment and see what
<a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/location/Location.html#toString%28%29"><strong>Location.toString()</strong></a>
looks like on the console for every new location we receive.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/content/stop_mocking_me_05.png" alt="" class="ui fluid image" />
<em>You’re kidding me.</em></p>

<p>So apparently the Brazil locations from our Fake GPS provider get properly flagged as mock locations. Except for 
those that do not. I had a major incident of <em>Schnappatmung</em> (you may look that up in a German dictionary).</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>It can be more or less frequent, but eventually you will see it happen: If you switch on a fake location provider, 
every now and then a fake location will arrive that is <em>not labeled as a mock</em>. Obviously, this is detrimental if your
application is relying on <strong>.isFromMockProvider()</strong> to reject fake locations. One such false negative is enough to 
screw up your use case.</p>

<p>It’s funny that the culprit mock location has a much poorer accuracy than the other location readings. I’m pretty 
sure the fake GPS provider is always sending locations with the same accuracy, which leads me to believe that the 
incorrectly labeled location is the result of some erroneous fusion logic inside Google’s API.</p>

<h3 id="the-remedy">The Remedy</h3>

<p>Since <em>most</em> location readings are correctly labeled, it’s not too difficult to identify and reject the false
negatives. I chose the following strategy:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Remember the most recent location labeled as a mock</li>
  <li>If a new “non-mock” reading is within 1km of the last mock, reject it.</li>
  <li>Only clear the last mock location after 20 consecutive “non-mock” readings.</li>
</ul>

<p>This simple approach proved to work very well in practice. Theoretically, if the very first reading was a false 
negative, this logic would still be fooled. However, given my assumption that the reading stems from some API fusion 
logic, such a reading would only ever occur <em>after</em> a couple of regular (mock) readings. Here’s the rejection 
strategy in action:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/content/stop_mocking_me_06.png" alt="" class="ui fluid image" />
<em>That feels better…</em></p>

<h3 id="the-takeaway">The Takeaway</h3>

<p>No matter whether you have valiantly plowed through the entire blog post or simply skipped to this section - you
have come to the right place. Let me introduce you to … the <strong>LocationAssistant</strong>. He’s your knight in shining armor
and your new best buddy.</p>

<p>I have tried to abstract and hide away all the gory, boring and irrelevant details of setting up and subscribing to 
location updates. The <strong>LocationAssistant</strong> provides a 
<a href="https://github.com/klaasnotfound/LocationAssistant#locationassistantlistener">Listener</a> 
interface that contains relevant events, upon some of which you may need to or want to interact with the user. It also 
provides 
<a href="https://github.com/klaasnotfound/LocationAssistant#locationassistant-1">a few methods</a>
that let you switch stuff on and off.</p>

<p>If you want, you can use the <strong>LocationAssistant</strong> to reject mock locations, but you don’t have to. I believe you 
will find it useful either way. Now head on over to GitHub and get it. If you like it, please star it, fork it or 
contribute. If you spot errors or have enhancements feel free to submit a pull request.</p>
